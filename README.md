# MiddleClickDefinition
A VS extension that lets you use middleclicks to trigger Go To Definition, Go To Implementation, Peek Definition, Find References and Find In Files.

This makes navigating code feel more like a browser. I couldn't live without it!

To download the extension, find it on Visual Studio Marketplace for [VS2022](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=norachuga.MiddleClickDefinition64) or [older versions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=norachuga.MiddleClickDefinition).


This extension is based on the old _Ctrl-Click Go To Definition_ extension by Noah Richards, which became an official part of VS long ago.
